            - for CPLEX : -I cplexinstaller.bin 
            
            - for GUROBI: -I gurobi.lic
        
        -L/--license is mandatory for GUROBI
        
            -L gurobi.lic

### Windows with Vagrant
Requirements:

  Installation requires Windows 7 Pro 64bit SP1 or higher and PowerShell 3.0 or higher. Furthermore, the CPU must support hardware virtualization. On many systems, the hardware virtualization features first need to be enabled in the BIOS.

- Install Git for Windows (use default settings) https://git-for-windows.github.io/

- Install VirtualBox and Extension Pack https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

- Install Vagrant https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

- Run Git Bash

- In a Git Bash terminal, type:

      ./plan4res_install.sh [-S <SOLVER>] [-I <installer>] [-L <license>] [-v <version>] [-M <mpi>] [-U <software>] [-V <memory>] [-C] [-H]

     -V/--vagrant is mandatory to install on Vagrant

             memory is the amount of memory you wish to allocate to your virtual machine. It must be a multiple of 1024

          other options have the same behavior than in Linux
